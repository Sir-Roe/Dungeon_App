An aboleth is a large, tentacled, amphibious creature with powerful psychic abilities. Being incredibly ancient, aboleths are said to predate even the gods of the world, and their vast knowledge and power make them a terrifying foe. They are known for their ability to manipulate minds, often enslaving whole armies or bending entire cities to their will. In combat, they can unleash waves of psychic energy and create illusions to confuse and disorient their enemies. Aboleths are feared by many creatures and are often regarded as one of the most dangerous foes one can face in the world of Dungeons and Dragons.
