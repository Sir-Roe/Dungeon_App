A dryad in Dungeons and Dragons is a fey creature that is closely attuned to nature. Usually found in clearings or forests, dryads are known to bond with specific trees, sharing a connection that allows them to sense nearby events and even communicate with other plant life. They are peaceful creatures, but fiercely protective of their chosen trees and will not hesitate to defend them against threats. When provoked, dryads can use their powers to charm or cause fear in those who would harm their homes.
