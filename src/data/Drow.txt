A Drow, also known as a dark elf, is a humanoid creature from the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy world. They have dark skin, white hair, and red eyes which allow them to see in complete darkness. Highly intelligent and cunning, they are known for their skills in magic and stealth. Drow society is matriarchal, with powerful priestesses and rulers. They are often depicted as villains, living in underground cities and conducting nefarious schemes against surface dwellers. However, some Drow characters have risen above their heritage to become heroes.
