An Adult Red Dragon is an enormous and formidable creature from the Dungeons and Dragons universe. Its scales are a deep red hue, tinged with black along the edges, and its sharp claws and teeth are capable of tearing through armor and flesh with ease. The dragon is able to breathe fire in a cone-shaped burst, scorching everything in its path. Its intelligence is on par with a human's, making it even more dangerous as it can use its cunning to outsmart its foes.
