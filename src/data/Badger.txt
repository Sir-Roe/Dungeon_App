In Dungeons and Dragons, a Badger is a small, stout predator known for its ferocity and tenacity. They are most commonly found in wilderness areas such as forests and fields, and are known for their sharp claws and teeth. Though they may seem easy to defeat, badgers are notoriously difficult opponents, known for their ability to withstand even the most brutal attacks. As such, they are often used as guards or sentinels, and are feared by adventurers who underestimate their strength.
