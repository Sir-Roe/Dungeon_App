An adult bronze dragon is an enormous and powerful creature, with a wingspan that can reach up to 80 feet. Its shimmering, metallic scales provide natural armor, and its razor-sharp claws and teeth can deal lethal damage. Known for its intelligence and wisdom, a bronze dragon prefers to use diplomacy and negotiation rather than violence when dealing with other creatures. They can also breathe both lightning and repulsion gas, making them formidable opponents in battle. An adult bronze dragon is a regal and noble creature, respected by many in the D&D universe.
