An air elemental is a creature of swirling winds and gusts, with no discernible form. They are often summoned by spellcasters to assist in battle or provide transportation. They are immune to physical attacks and can travel through solid objects, making them difficult to pin down. They can also fly at high speeds and create intense gusts of wind that can knock opponents off balance. However, they are vulnerable to lightning-based attacks and can be dispelled if their summoner is defeated or their concentration is broken.
