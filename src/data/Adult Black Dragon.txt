The Adult Black Dragon is a ferocious creature that dominates the swamp regions of the world. It has a thick, scaly hide that's black as coal, and its eyes gleam with an ominous red glow. Its claws and teeth are razor-sharp, each able to rend even the toughest of prey. The dragon's mastery of acid means that it can spit this powerful substance at great distances, dissolving almost anything in its path. These dragons are highly intelligent, with a cunning and vicious nature that makes them feared among even the most battle-hardened adventurers.
